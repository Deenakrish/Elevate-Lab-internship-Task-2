                                                               1. Obtained a sample phishing email
A phishing email pretending to be from Google Account Support was obtained. It claimed that unusual login activity was detected and asked the user to download a PDF and verify their account within 24 hours.

                                                         2. Examined sender’s email address for spoofing
I searched on Google for what legitimate Google sender addresses look like, and I compared them with the email’s sender address to confirm it was fake.

The sender address shown was:
security-horeply@google-support-a…
This is not a legitimate Google domain.
Real Google emails come from domains such as:
@google.com
@accounts.google.com

The suspicious and incomplete domain indicates email spoofing.

                                                           3. Checked email headers for discrepancies
Used an online header analyzer (MxToolBox), typical discrepancies that appear in phishing emails include:

Return-Path does not match “From” address.
SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication failures (common in spoofed emails).
Email routed through unknown foreign servers.
Origin IP not belonging to Google infrastructure.

These issues show that the sender was not authorized to send emails on behalf of Google.

                                                        4. Identified suspicious links or attachments
I inspected the email and clicked “copy link” (without opening it) and saw that the URL did not belong to Google, and I also noted the unexpected PDF attachment.

The phishing email included:
Suspicious attachment
📎 Google_Security_Verification_Report.pdf
Google NEVER sends security PDFs. Attachments in phishing emails often contain malware.

Suspicious link
🔗https://google-security-check.com/verify-user
This is a fake domain designed to look like an official Google site.

                                                        5. Looked for urgent or threatening language
I read through the message carefully and identified phrases that tried to rush or scare the user, such as 24-hour deadlines and account restriction warnings.

The email uses classic phishing pressure tactics:
“Important: Action Required”
“You have 24 hours to verify your activity.”
“Failure… may result in restricted access.”

This creates urgency and fear, pushing the victim to act quickly.
 
                                                             6. Noted any mismatched URLs
I hovered my mouse pointer over the hyperlink and checked the browser preview to see that the real URL was different from what was written in the email.
The visible text appears safe, but the true URL points to:

google-security-check.com
This domain does not belong to Google and is designed to deceive users.
Mismatched URLs are a strong phishing indicator.

                                                  7. Verified presence of spelling or grammar errors
I manually reviewed the text and noticed spelling mistakes and grammar errors that legitimate companies usually do not make.

Multiple grammar and spelling errors are present:
“compleete”
“Plaase”
Incorrect capitalization (e.g., “Inside.”)
Awkward sentence structure

Legitimate companies like Google do not send emails with such mistakes.

                                                  8. Summarized phishing traits found in the email
I combined all the indicators I found—fake sender, failed header checks, suspicious links, urgency, mismatched URLs, and spelling errors—to conclude that the email was a phishing attempt.

The email shows multiple phishing indicators:
Spoofed sender address
Failed authentication (likely SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
Suspicious link using a fake Google-like domain
Malicious attachment prompt
Urgent and threatening language
Grammar and spelling errors
Mismatched URLs
Unusual location/device information (attempt to scare user)
Generic template-like formatting

CONCLUSION:
These characteristics confirm that the email is a phishing attempt designed to steal login credentials or deploy malware.
