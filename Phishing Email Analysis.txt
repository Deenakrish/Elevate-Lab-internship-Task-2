                                                                        1. Obtained a sample phishing email
A phishing email pretending to be from Google Account Support was obtained. It claimed that unusual login activity was detected and asked the user to download a PDF and verify their account within 24 hours.

                                                                    2. Examined sender’s email address for spoofing
The sender address shown was:
security-horeply@google-support-a…
This is not a legitimate Google domain.
Real Google emails come from domains such as:
@google.com
@accounts.google.com


The suspicious and incomplete domain indicates email spoofing.

                                                                        3. Checked email headers for discrepancies
Using an online header analyzer (e.g., Google Admin Toolbox), typical discrepancies that appear in phishing emails include:


Return-Path does not match “From” address.
SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication failures (common in spoofed emails).
Email routed through unknown foreign servers.
Origin IP not belonging to Google infrastructure.

These issues show that the sender was not authorized to send emails on behalf of Google.

                                                                     4. Identified suspicious links or attachments
The phishing email included:

Suspicious attachment
📎 Google_Security_Verification_Report.pdf
Google NEVER sends security PDFs. Attachments in phishing emails often contain malware.

Suspicious link
🔗https://google-security-check.com/verify-user
This is a fake domain designed to look like an official Google site.

                                                                       5. Looked for urgent or threatening language
The email uses classic phishing pressure tactics:


“Important: Action Required”
“You have 24 hours to verify your activity.”
“Failure… may result in restricted access.”

This creates urgency and fear, pushing the victim to act quickly.
 
                                                                             6. Noted any mismatched URLs
When hovering over the link text, the visible text appears safe, but the true URL points to:

google-security-check.com
This domain does not belong to Google and is designed to deceive users.
Mismatched URLs are a strong phishing indicator.

                                                                    7. Verified presence of spelling or grammar errors
Multiple grammar and spelling errors are present:


“compleete”
“Plaase”
Incorrect capitalization (e.g., “Inside.”)
Awkward sentence structure

Legitimate companies like Google do not send emails with such mistakes.

                                                                        8. Summarized phishing traits found in the email

The email shows multiple phishing indicators:
    
Spoofed sender address
Failed authentication (likely SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
Suspicious link using a fake Google-like domain
Malicious attachment prompt
Urgent and threatening language
Grammar and spelling errors
Mismatched URLs
Unusual location/device information (attempt to scare user)
Generic template-like formatting

These characteristics confirm that the email is a phishing attempt designed to steal login credentials or deploy malware.
